    - $desc: Long-term Memory
      longMemory: Enable long-term memory feature (requires vector database and Embeddings service).
      longMemorySimilarity: Set long-term memory similarity threshold (0.0 to 1.0, where higher values require closer matches).
      longMemoryTFIDFThreshold: Set TF-IDF threshold for long-term memory retrieval (0.0 to 1.0, where higher values require closer matches). If set to 0, the most closest matches will be retrieved.
      longMemoryDuplicateCheck: Enable similarity check. If enabled, the model will check the similarity between new memory and existing memory before adding to long-term memory. If the similarity is too high, the new memory will not be added to long-term memory.
      longMemoryDuplicateThreshold: Set similarity threshold for long-term memory retrieval before adding (0.0 to 1.0, where higher values require closer matches). If set to 0, the most strict check will be performed. If the retrieved memory exceeds this threshold, it will not be added to long-term memory.
      longMemoryInterval: Set long-term memory save frequency (number of conversation turns between memory lookups, e.g., 5 means save memory every 5 turns).
      longMemoryExtractModel: Specify the model for long-term memory extraction. Faster models improve extraction speed.
      longMemoryNewQuestionSearch: Enable new question search. If enabled, the model will generate new questions before searching long-term memory.
      longMemoryLayer:
          $desc: Enabled long-term memory layers
          $inner:
            - Global layer. Memories in this layer are shared across all rooms.
            - Preset layer. Memories in this layer are shared across rooms with the same preset.
            - Preset/User layer. This layer is the primary retrieval layer for long-term memory. User chat memories are added to this layer by default. This layer is differentiated for different users and presets.
            - User layer. Memories in this layer are unique to each user but shared across all presets.
